<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## About

This project came about from my idea of not wasting food. You can search for recipes based on whatever food you have an excess of, or whatever food is nearing its expiration date. From there, you can save your recipes into your cookbook where they will be stored in one consolidated location.
On the back-end of this project, I used Django and Python. For the database, I used PostgreSQL. To develop the front-end, I used JavaScript and React, along with HTML/CSS.
